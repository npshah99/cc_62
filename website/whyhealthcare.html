		<h1>WHY HEALTH CARE ?</h1>
		<form>
			<p>If your health fails, it can overshadow everything else thatâ€™s going on in your life. From relatively minor health issues such as aches and pains, lethargy, and indigestion to major health problems that can threaten your existence, health can really affect happiness and stress levels. </p>
			<br>	
			<p>This is particularly important as it relates to stress. The stress that comes from poor health is significant because when you are facing a health challenge, it affects so many areas of your life. Daily tasks become more challenging, health expenses can pile up, and your ability to earn a living can even be in jeopardy. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Stress itself can exacerbate health issues from the common cold to more serious conditions and diseases, so it really pays to maintain healthy stress management habits not only to be able to manage the stress of poor health, but to help avoid it altogether by staying healthier longer.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p><b><h3>Here are a few healthy habits that carry a big impact:</h3></b></p>
			<br>
			<p>1.Eat a Healthy Diet for the Right Reasons</p>
			<br>
			<p>2.Make Sleep a Priority</p>
			<br>
			<p>3.Find a Fitness Habit That Works for You</p>
			<br>
			<p>4.Watch What You Put Into Your Body</p>
