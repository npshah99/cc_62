			<p>Try to wash your hair every 2-3 days, rather than every day. When you wash your hair too often, the water and products you use can strip away the natural oils produced by your scalp, which help to keep your hair healthy. When these oils are stripped away, your hair can become brittle and your scalp may begin to overproduce oil, which could make your hair very greasy. </p>
			<br>	
			<p>Use dry shampoo on the days you donâ€™t use an actual shampoo if you feel the need to wash your hair.</p>

			<p>When applying conditioner, try to only apply it to the longest parts of your hair, rather than directly on to your scalp; if you put conditioner on your scalp, it can make your hair very greasy and weigh your hair down. Work the conditioner into your hair with your fingers, leave it on your hair for a few moments, and then rinse it out.</p>
			<br>	
			<p>You do not necessarily need to use conditioner every time you wash your hair, particularly if you are prone to oily hair, but it can help to protect your hair against split ends.</p>

			<p>There are some natural powders that you can also use to give your hair a boost. These natural powers help to soften and nourish your hair. To apply them, simply rub a small amount of the powder into your scalp and hair.</p>
			<br>	
			<p>Common powders include mustard, ginger, Brahmi, and amla.</p>
